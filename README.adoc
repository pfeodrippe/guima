= TLA+ Web Repl

It runs a server to run TLA+/TLC expressions, very experimental, try it at
https://guima.cloud.


== Brainstorm

The main idea is to minimally introduce TLA+ concepts and operators. But for now,
the user will see a list of operators and try to use them (maybe exercises?).


== Ideas taken/inspired from
- https://github.com/tlaplus/PlusPy, well, we call this project to eval every
expression, obrigado!
- https://github.com/will62794/tlaplus_repl,
- https://maria.cloud, awesome editor, guima.cloud UI is heavily
inspired by it, gracias!


.Todo/Wish List
* [ ] Add comments (with edition) between code
* [ ] Act as a proxy for `learntla.com` website code. As an example, for
https://learntla.com/tla/sets/, the user could use https://learntla.guima.cloud/tla/sets/
and everything would stay the same, except you could evaluate the TLA+ code
(like a chrome extension modifying your code).
