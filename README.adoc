= TLA+ Web Repl

It runs a server to run TLA+/TLC expressions, very experimental, try it at ...

== Brainstorm

The main idea is to minimally introduce TLA+ concepts and operators. But for now,
the user will see a list of operators and try to use them (maybe exercises?).

== Ideas taken/inspired from

happen, thanks!
